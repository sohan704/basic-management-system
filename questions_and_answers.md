  <h1>MCQ TEST</h1>
</div>

###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>greetign is an empty object due to the assignment greetign = {};. 
 If greetign was not defined here, it would give a reference error like this "Uncaught ReferenceError: greetign is not defined" but since greetign is just an empty object. The output will be an empty object as well.

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a string and a number, it concatenates them together instead of performing numerical addition. This behavior is known as type coercion.

In the case of sum(1, "2"), a is 1 (a number) and b is "2" (a string). JavaScript tries to concatenate them, resulting in the string "12", not the numerical value 3.</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>The favoriteFood property of the info object is set to the value of food[0] which is just a value and then the favoriteFood property is changed to a new item which doesn't affect the food array in way so the initial array remains unchanged.

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

<i>When an argument isn't passed to a parameter in a function. 
The parameter is automatically set to undefined. So the name is undefined since there is no argument.</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>When the loop iterates through the nums array, it first encounters the 0 which is a falsy value so it doesn't increase the value of count but after that every non-zero number in the array is a truthy value so the count is increased by 1 and since there are total 3 truthy values. The count is 3 at the end.</i>
